# Sentiment Analysis on Drug Reviews
**Introduction**
This project focuses on using natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis on drug reviews. The aim is to analyze patientsâ€™ reviews and classify them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Sentiment analysis in the pharmaceutical industry can provide insights to healthcare professionals and stakeholders to improve patient drug experiences.

**Dataset**
The UCI Drug Review dataset was used, which contains 215,063 patient reviews. The reviews were categorized into three sentiment classes: positive, neutral, and negative based on the drug rating provided. The dataset exhibited class imbalance, which was addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

**Methods**
Data Preprocessing: Text reviews were preprocessed by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.
Traditional Machine Learning Models: Implemented Naive Bayes and Decision Trees with TF-IDF for feature extraction. The decision tree model achieved a test accuracy of 0.82 after using bigrams to improve feature representation.
Deep Learning Models: Used LSTM and CNN architectures to capture long-range relationships and features in the text. The LSTM model achieved the best performance with a test accuracy of 0.73 and an F1-score of 0.7289.

**Results**
The best-performing traditional model was the Decision Tree with bigrams, achieving a test accuracy of 0.82.
The best deep learning model was the LSTM, achieving a test accuracy of 0.73 and an F1-score of 0.7289, outperforming the CNN model.

**Conclusion**
Deep learning models, particularly LSTM, outperformed traditional models in sentiment analysis of drug reviews. However, traditional models like Decision Trees can still be useful in resource-limited situations due to their simplicity and efficiency.
